# Balance Tracker Hook

Monitors your portfolio balance across all connected exchanges and alerts you when significant changes occur.

## Features

- 📊 Tracks total portfolio value in USD
- 🔔 Alerts on balance changes > 5% (configurable)
- 📈 Daily/weekly balance summaries
- ⚠️ Large deposit/withdrawal detection
- 💾 Historical balance snapshots

## What It Does

1. **On heartbeat**: Fetches current balances from all exchanges
2. **On trade execution**: Updates balance and checks for significant changes
3. **Comparison**: Compares with last snapshot
4. **Alert**: If change exceeds threshold, sends notification
